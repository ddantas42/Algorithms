# Algorithm tester
This is a C program which I coded to experiment with hashtables in C, in this program I compares two searchs algorithms in an ordinated array, one with and regular vector using binary search, and the other using hashtables.

## Usage
To compile que program, simply use ```make``` and the program will compile and generate an executable with the command:
```bash
make all
```
And that's it! now simply execute
```bash
./algos
```
After you can use ```make clean``` to clean every object and the executable created.
To clean and recompile you can use ```make re```.
