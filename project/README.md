## Final Project
This project is about making queue system for hospital using linked list in C programming.

# The problem
ER in hospitals are a constant stressfull period, between people coming in, triage and then getting the help they need, a lot of stress can build up not only for the patients but for the staff as well.

# Solution
A program that automatizes with a few inputs the registering and exiting of patients, while logging everything along the way, and possible to keep track of how many and a few statistics options.

### Disclamer
This is a project that was made with the intention of deepning my knowledge about C programming, memory management and linked->Lists, to implement this in a real scenerio I would personally code in a platform of a windows App (perhaps using .NET), code an UI for ease of use and multiple modifications would have to be done to fully implement it.

# Usage
After using compiling the whole project using:
```bash
make all
```
We can just execute it using
```bash
./queue_system
```
After that, play around with it! Register new patients, call them to triage, do whatever! (if something break please tell me so i can fix it :D)

## Extras
In /inc/macros.h there is a couple macros you can play around with, mess with the triage time or attendance time, Maybe put in memory debug on to see what's happening behind the scenes
