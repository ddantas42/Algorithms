# Algorithm tester
This is a C program which I coded to experiment with TADs (Abstract Data Types), in this program i will implement two TADs, Matrix and Mala(Sack)

## Usage
To compile que program, simply use ```make``` at the desired folder (each to test their specific TAD) and the program will compile and generate an executable with the command:
```bash
make all
```
And that's it! now simply execute
```bash
./mala
```
or 
```bash
./matrix
```
After you can use ```make clean``` to clean every object and the executable created.
To clean and recompile you can use ```make re```.
